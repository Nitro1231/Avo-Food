# Avo-Food   
Providing meal information at Avon Old Farms School.   

# Purpose of this project   
#### Providing a meal menu information for students!   
We consider the student's inconvenience and develop a product that can solve the problem.   

#### Providing a feedback system.   
We will provide the voting system for the students so they can feedback on whether the food was good or not. It would be nice if we can build the communication system between students and meal providers.   

#### The main reason for using a web-based system for providing the meal information is...   
1. To reduce the over traffic on the API server.
2. Provide the same environment over different devices.
3. Do not need the server for hosting or updating the data. (Github Action.)
